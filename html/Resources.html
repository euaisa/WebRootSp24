              <li>
                    <strong>Accelerometer:</strong>
                    <p>Measures acceleration forces in three axes. Used for orientation detection, motion sensing, and gaming applications. Utilizes microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to detect changes in orientation and movement by measuring changes in capacitance or resistance. Similar functionality and performance across iPhones and Android devices.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>Gyroscope:</strong>
                    <p>Measures angular velocity around three axes. Enables more accurate motion tracking and stabilization. Relies on a MEMS structure to detect rotational changes, providing precise orientation data. Generally consistent performance across both iPhones and Android phones.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>Magnetometer (Compass):</strong>
                    <p>Detects the Earth's magnetic field to determine the device's orientation relative to magnetic north. Uses Hall Effect sensors to measure magnetic field intensity and direction. Differences in calibration and implementation can affect accuracy, but both iPhones and Android devices use similar technology.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>Proximity Sensor:</strong>
                    <p>Detects the presence of nearby objects without physical contact. Commonly used for screen auto-brightness adjustment and preventing accidental touch inputs during calls.  Uses an infrared LED or laser to emit light and measures the reflection to determine proximity. Similar functionality across devices, but calibration and sensitivity may vary.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>Ambient Light Sensor:</strong>
                    <p>Measures the ambient light levels to adjust screen brightness automatically. Utilizes photodiodes or phototransistors to detect the amount of light falling on the sensor. Implementation may vary, resulting in slight differences in responsiveness and accuracy.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>Barometer:</strong>
                    <p>Measures air pressure to estimate altitude and provide weather-related data. Uses a pressure sensor to detect changes in air pressure, which can be converted to altitude readings. Similar functionality across devices, but calibration and integration with other sensors may differ.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>GPS (Global Positioning System):</strong>
                    <p>Determines the device's precise location by receiving signals from GPS satellites. Calculates position based on the time delay of signals from multiple satellites. Both iPhones and Android devices rely on the same GPS satellites, but implementation in software and hardware can vary.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                    <strong>Fingerprint Sensor (Touch ID/Fingerprint Scanner):</strong>
                    <p>Biometric authentication method for unlocking devices and authorizing transactions. Captures and analyzes unique fingerprint patterns using capacitive or optical sensors. Apple iPhones typically use proprietary Touch ID technology, while Android devices may use various fingerprint sensor technologies from different manufacturers.</p>
